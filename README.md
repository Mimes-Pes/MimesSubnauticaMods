### Extra Tabs (Legacy)

[Extra Tabs v0.1.0](https://github.com/Mimes-Pes/MimesSubnauticaMods/raw/main/ExtraTabs-0.1.0.zip "Download")

This mod is more of a mod for my personal use rather than a mod to be used by many players. It is included here in case some finds it useful. I felt a need to organise menus in Fabricator and Workbench to be more manageable and easier to view and use. I play Subnautica with 145 mods which made these menus very hard to use. This mod requires CustomCrasft2SML mod.

To use this mod, one needs to do the following:

1. Unzip ExtraTabs directory into QMods directory
2. Unzip file OrganisedTabs_MovedRecipes.txt into QMods\CustomCraft2SML\WorkingFiles directory

One can also slightly modify other mods to move their tabs into newly created sub-tabs.

[![ExtraTabs](https://github.com/Mimes-Pes/MimesSubnauticaMods/blob/main/ExtraTabs.png?raw=true "ExtraTabs")](https://github.com/Mimes-Pes/MimesSubnauticaMods/blob/main/ExtraTabs.png?raw=true "ExtraTabs")

### Immersive Outcrop Break (Legacy)

[ImmersiveOutcropBreak v0.9.5](https://github.com/Mimes-Pes/MimesSubnauticaMods/raw/main/ImmersiveOutcropBreak-0.9.5.zip "Download")

This mod aims at improving immersion in  Subnautica. Many, many thanks go to Metious, who tirelessly helped me out with the 3D side of things. Outcrops are now unable to be broken by bare hands. They can be broken by tools (as per vanilla) or if a player has (any) gloves equipped. With this mod there is no more clink sound on outcrop with bare hands, which sounded a bit odd. Gloves for braking outcrops are made of Titanium so clink sound when bashing outcrops is to be expected. With this mod, player can also make a Glove Chip, which project on HUD storage metrics, such as inventory size or free inventory slots left. Glove Chips and Advanced Outcrop Gloves now help with breaking outcrops, to the point where with most advanced equipment outcrops are broken and ores are picked up automatically, without a single click - let those clickety fingers rest while you collect all the goodies.

[![ImmersiveOutcropBreak v0.9.5](https://github.com/Mimes-Pes/MimesSubnauticaMods/blob/main/ImmersiveOutcropBreak-01.png?raw=true "ImmersiveOutcropBreak v0.9.5")](https://github.com/Mimes-Pes/MimesSubnauticaMods/blob/main/ImmersiveOutcropBreak-01.png?raw=true "ImmersiveOutcropBreak")

[Download v 0.1.0](https://github.com/Mimes-Pes/MimesSubnauticaMods/raw/main/MoreChipSlots-0.1.0.zip "Download")

This simple mod adds up to 6 extra Chip slots in the PDA. Players can now use up to 8 items requiring a module inserted into the Chip slot simultaneously. Extra number of chip slots is configurable.

### Oxygen Audio Monitor (Legacy)

[Download v 0.1.0](https://github.com/Mimes-Pes/MimesSubnauticaMods/raw/main/OxygenAudioMonitor-0.1.0.zip "Download")

Oxygen Audio Monitor Chip uses Stalker sounds coded in their tooth DNA, which it converts to warning messages for O2 levels at 50, 25, 10%, and 30s of O2 left. This mod is compatible with Scuba Mainfold mod.

[![OxygenAudioMonitor](https://github.com/Mimes-Pes/MimesSubnauticaMods/blob/main/OxygenAudioMonitor-01.png?raw=true "OxygenAudioMonitor")](https://github.com/Mimes-Pes/MimesSubnauticaMods/blob/main/OxygenAudioMonitor-01.png?raw=true "OxygenAudioMonitor")

### Oxygen Canisters (Legacy)
### Idea and parts of code misappropriated (with permission), added cool graphics, skins, lore logic and a chip, and converted to Subnautica Legacy from the original mod by Ramune

This mod will not spam player's Subnautica experience with pirate nonsense, unlike the original exclusive for BepInEx mod, which tries to "guess" if a player purchased or pirated Subnautica game.

[Download v 0.1.0](https://github.com/Mimes-Pes/MimesSubnauticaMods/raw/main/OxygenCanisters-1.0.0.zip "Download")

Technology to fabricate oxygen canisters is unlocked by acquiring a fragment from Oxygen producing Brain Coral. It is a disposable canister providing player with 35 seconds of additional Oxygen. Canister is made out of titanium and Fiber Mesh, together with Oxygen rich Brain Coral Piece. Oxygen Canister Monitor Chip projects Oxygen canister count and other canister information onto HUD. Quick consume key is now configurable.

Sometimes, "Redeem a Key Button" and "Troubleshooting Button" may get in the way to display important buttons, such as "Mods" button. This tiny mod will let you correct that.

I am afraid that is the extend of my Subnautica modding contribution, most of which I got help from legendary people like code guru Metious, 2D virtuozo Al-An, Unity expert AndreaDev-3D, inspirational Holograms, and immaculate tester Kelsarhu (Rose).
